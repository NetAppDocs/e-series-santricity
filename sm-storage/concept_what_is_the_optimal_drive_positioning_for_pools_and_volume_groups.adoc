When creating pools and volume groups, make sure to balance the drive selection between the upper and lower drive slots.

For the EF600 and EF300 controllers, drive slots 0-11 are connected to one PCI bridge, while slots 12-23 are connected to a different PCI bridge. For optimal performance, you should balance the drive selection to include a roughly equal number of drives from the upper and lower slots. This positioning ensures that your volumes do not hit a bandwidth limit sooner than necessary.
