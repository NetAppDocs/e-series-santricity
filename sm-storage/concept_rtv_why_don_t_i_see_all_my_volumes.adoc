When configuring an import for the Remote Storage feature, you might notice that some volumes do not appear in the list of target candidates due to block size, capacity, or volume availability.

To appear in the list, volume candidates must have:

* Capacity that is equal to or larger than the remote volume.
* Block size that is the same as the remote volume.
* Current status of Optimal.

Volumes candidates are excluded from the list if they have:

* Any of the following relationships: volume copy, snapshot, or mirroring.
* Reconfiguration operation in progress.
* Mapping to another device (host or host cluster).
* Read flash cache enabled.
