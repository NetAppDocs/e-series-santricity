You can create an access token to authenticate with the REST API or command line interface (CLI) in place of a username and password.

When creating tokens, be aware that:

* Tokens do not have passwords, so you must manage them carefully.
* Once an access token expires, the userâ€™s authentication attempts will fail.

.Steps

. Select menu:Settings[Access Management].
. Select the *Access Tokens* tab.
. Select *View/Edit Access Token Settings*. In the dialog box, make sure that the *Enable access tokens* checkbox is selected. Click *Save* to close out the dialog box.
. Select *Create Access Token*.
. In the dialog box, select the duration for the token to be valid. After the token expires, authentication attempts will fail.
. Click *Create.*
. In the dialog box, select one of the following:
  * *Copy* to save the token text to the clipboard.
  * *Download* to save the token text to a file.
+
NOTE: Be sure to save the token text. You will not have another opportunity to see the text after you close this dialog.
+
. Click *Close*.
. Use the token as follows:
* *Rest API*: To use a token in a REST API request, add an HTTP header to your requests:
`Authorization: Bearer _<access-token-value>_`
* *Secure CLI*: To use a token in the CLI, add the token value on the command line or use the path to a file containing the token value.
+
** Token value on the command line: `-t _access-token-value_`
** Path to a file containing the token value: `-T _access-token-file_`
+
NOTE: If no username, password, or token is specified, the CLI prompts the user for an access token value on the command line.
