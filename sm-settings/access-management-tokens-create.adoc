You can create access tokens, which are used to authenticate with the REST API or Command Line Interface in place of a username and password.

NOTE: If SAML is enabled, access tokens are the _only_ way you can use the REST API and CLI.

.Steps

. Select menu:Settings[Access Management].
. Select the *Access Tokens* tab.
. _access tokens must be enabled -- do it in View/Edit Access Token Settings. Or is there another place to enable it?_

_in progress_
