[.lead]
An access token contains the security credentials for a login session and identifies the user, groups, and privileges.

In E-Series systems, these tokens are used to authenticate with the REST API or Command Line Interface in place of a username an password. If SAML is enabled, access tokens are the _only_ way you can use the REST API and CLI.
